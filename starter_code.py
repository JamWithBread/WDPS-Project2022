    # to leverage the context in the webpage. For instance, if you know that the
    # webpage refers to persons then you can query the knowledge base to filter
    # out all the entities that are not persons...

    # Obviously, more sophisticated implementations that the one suggested
    # above are more than welcome :-)

    # For now, we are cheating. We are going to return the labels that we stored
    # in sample-labels-cheat.txt Instead of doing that, you should process the
